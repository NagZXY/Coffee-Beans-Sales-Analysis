My latest data analysis on coffee bean sales across major Saudi cities reveals some fascinating insights:

**Costa Rica Beans** sold the most, but **Colombian Beans** led in revenue due to a higher unit price.
**Ethiopian Beans**, a luxury choice, generated strong revenue despite lower sales volume.
**Guatemala Beans** underperformed, while **Brazilian Beans**—the most affordable—sold well but brought in the least revenue.

**Hail** topped the charts as the highest revenue-generating city, closely followed by Jeddah and Riyadh, each surpassing $65K in revenue from Jan 2023 – Dec 2024.
**January 2024** was the best month for revenue, while **February 2023** was the lowest.
